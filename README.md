# testing_nn_libraries contains 2 nn libraries used in a college assignment.

# nn_lib is a simple feed forward network which uses sum of squares error

# nn_lib_cp similarly is a feed forward network, however it uses CUDA enabled gpu's to 
# speed up computations, and requires that the final layer use the softmax activation function.
# This library will not run without a CUDA enabled gpu and cupy installed.
